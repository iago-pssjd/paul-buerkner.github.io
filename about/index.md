I am a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group
Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech in Stuttgart (Germany). I am the
author of the R package [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and member
of the [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) Development Team. Previously, I have studied
Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen and did my
PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. I have also
worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University (Finland), Department of
Computer Science. See [here](../publications) for an overview of my scientific
publications.
